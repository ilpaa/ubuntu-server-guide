## Getting Started with Ubuntu Server

Before you can set up network storage with Samba, you'll need to install Ubuntu Server on your hardware. Here's how to get started:

### Step 1: Download Ubuntu Server ISO Image

Visit the [official Ubuntu Server download page](https://ubuntu.com/download/server) to download the latest version of Ubuntu Server. Choose the appropriate architecture (e.g., 64-bit) and click on the download link to save the ISO image to your computer.

### Step 2: Create Bootable USB Drive

To install Ubuntu Server, you'll need to create a bootable USB drive using a tool like Rufus. Here's how to do it:

1. Download [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) and launch the application.
2. Insert a USB flash drive (8GB or larger) into your computer.
3. In Rufus, select the USB drive under "Device" and choose the Ubuntu Server ISO image under "Boot selection".
4. Leave all other settings at their default values and click "Start" to create the bootable USB drive.

### Step 3: Install Ubuntu Server

Insert the bootable USB drive into the computer where you want to install Ubuntu Server and boot from it. Follow the on-screen instructions to install Ubuntu Server, choosing options such as language, keyboard layout, and disk partitioning as needed.

Once Ubuntu Server is installed and configured, you're ready to proceed with setting up network storage using Samba.
